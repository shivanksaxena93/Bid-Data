# Meetup Report #2

## Chicago Python Data Science Special Interest Group Meetup
### -Organized by Metis (April 18, 2018) 

### Summary

The lecturer Zax Rosenberg who is a data scientist and Chartered Financial Analyst at SPINS delivered a versatile talk on Machine learning and its paradigms from the scratch. Starting with Association Rule learning which is a method used for discovering interesting pattern between variables in large databases in human understandable way. Basically it is a technique to uncover how items are associated to each other. This can be measured by using 4 ways which are:

1. Support
2. Confidence
3. Lift
4. Conviction

Later he discussed which rules are important over others and which occurs frequently following the benifits of association rule which can be described as Mrket analysis, Web minning, Document analysis, Telecommunication alarm diagnosis and network intrusion detection.

It includes different variables such as:-
Terminologies
Transactions
Itemset
Antecent
Consequent

He also described the use of Preprocessing.binary in python which includes scaling, standardization,label encoding, one hot encoding for preparing data and collectively helps in binding of data.

Lately different types of machine learning algorithms were discussed such as
a) Supervised machine learning algorithms: Learns from the past to new data using labeled examples for future predictions.
b) Unsupervised machine learning algorithms: When traing data is not either classified or labeled. The chances of correct output remains very low but unlabeled data is explored.
c) Semi-supervised machine learning algorithms: It acts as an intermediator between the above two as it uses both labeled and unlabeled data for training.
d) Reinforcement machine learning algorithms: It helps in interaction with the environment with their actions.

Finally the algorithms were explained in detail using the examples which were 
### Conclusion
 
It can be concluded that machines learning is the next era as the machines will become capable of performing and improving independently without coding explicitly. 

### Observations 

This meetup gave me an opportunity to meet the elite class data scientist and engineers who had been working on data and its technologies for years. This helped me to learn a lot about professional environment and data industry. It was an informative session as well which helped me widening my horizons of thinking capebilities and implementing a logical approach towards my problems.

Data Science is the answer to all..!!
As the data comprises of everything for the letter A to large processed algorithms.

### Comments about the subject

Machine learning delivers faster and more accurate results in order to identify profitable opportunities or dangerous risks, it may also require additional time and resources to train it properly. Combining machine learning with AI and cognitive technologies can make it even more effective in processing large volumes of information.
